# Project Title

Customer churn prediction and Analysis of Telecom Dataset Using Random forest classifier

## Acknowledgements

- I developed a customer churn prediction model using a Random Forest Classifier on a telecommunications dataset. The model achieved an accuracy score of 80%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting customer churn. By analyzing various features such as customer demographics, services subscribed, and usage patterns, the model accurately identifies customers at risk of leaving the telecommunications service. This predictive insight enables proactive retention strategies and helps minimize customer attrition, ultimately contributing to improved customer retention and business profitability.
