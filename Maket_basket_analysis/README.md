Market Basket Analysis Project: Unveiling Consumer Purchase Patterns in Groceries

## Acknowledgements

- This project delves into the realm of market basket analysis by leveraging the power of the Apriori algorithm. Through meticulous data mining techniques, I identified significant item associations and uncovered hidden patterns within a comprehensive groceries dataset. By applying Apriori, I discerned frequent itemsets and generated association rules, providing actionable insights for retailers to optimize product placement, enhance cross-selling strategies, and personalize marketing approaches.
